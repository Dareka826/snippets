# Rin's Snippets

A collection of files that don't deserve their own repos, but are useful nonetheless.

What's inside (may not be exhaustive):
- An implementation for an arena allocator in C99
- A header file for aliasing types to more modern names like in Zig or Rust
- A simple \[memory buffer + length\] struct with utils
